# Project Description

This project consists of creating a software for a company that aims to facilitate product transactions between other companies on a national level. The software should not only enable transactions, but also allow for the collection and delivery of orders. The company will have a warehouse in each district and a fleet of vehicles for collecting and delivering orders. In this sense, the software should store all information about companies, products, purchases and product shipments.

# Goals

Develop our skills related to agile software development, focusing on practices that ensure software quality, including: 

- Software testing; 
- Implementation of Software Configuration Management practices;
- Regularly conducting code inspections;
- Following a Continuous Integration approach to support and automate the software building process as much as possible;

**Increasing our abilities to:**

- Analyze a problem and identify requirements, business rules, and use cases;
- Specify and execute a set of readable test cases;
- Distinguish between black box and white box testing (with identification of coverage) and choose the appropriate tests for each use case;
- Use agile development methodologies and support tools;
- Establish a mature development plan involving a work team;
- Regularly inspect the code through the identification, collection, and analysis of a specific set of metrics related to software product quality, and related to other quality factors besides system behavior.
